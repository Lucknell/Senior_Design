# Senior Design Project

Objective: To create a wireless charging system for a battery enabled vehicle. Will include a Hall Effect sensor which will detect the magnetic field of a magnet that will be placed on the vehicle. After 3 seconds of constant contact, which will simulate if the vehicle is parked, a micro controller will signal to start the charging. Once the vehicle starts to move, the charging will stop.

Potential finish date: Late November 2018.
